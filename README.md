# riemann
riemann image with built in InfluxDB

this image will assume that InfluxDB is sitting at 10.0.2.15:8086, and has a database in it called 'riemann'

### Your host may be a different IP to talk to InfluxDB, so that would have to be configured, but you can always copy the config file and mount it over mine
